## Growth Markdown
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

***difference between growth and fixed mindset:***

**Growth mindset**

*unorderd list*
- Embraces challenges
- persist the obstacle 
- more effort "no pain, no gain 
- learns from criticism 
- inspired by success of others 
- will achieve more & higher goals

**Fixed mindset**

*unorderd list*
- Avoids challenges 
- Loses focus in obstacle
- views effort as fruitless 
- ignores criticism 
- seeing success of others as a threat 
- fails to reach full potential
