# What is a Computer

#### Initially, as a new user, one should be introduced with the machine, which is known as Computer. So, a computer is an electronic device that requires a power supply to work. Power Supply is the lifeline of a computer as water is the lifeline for a human body. A computer machine is used to process the information provided by us. It takes information or data from one end, store it to process, and finally, after completing the processing, it output the result on the other hand. The information it takes at one end is known as Computer Input, and the result that it provides after processing is known as Computer Output. The place where it stores the information is known as Computer Memory or RAM (Random Access Memory). A computer system stores information in bits. Bits is the smallest storage unit of a computer.

## Major Components of a Computer

#### A computer system works by combining input, storage space, processing, and output. These four are the major components of a Computer.
Let's understand one by one:

### Input:
#### An input is the information that we provide to the Computer. We provide the information using the Computer's input devices: Keyboard, mouse, microphone, and many more. For example, when we type something using a keyboard, it is known as an Input provided to the Computer.
Storage Space: It is the place where our input gets stored. It is known as Computer Memory that keeps the data into it. A computer uses a hard drive for storing files and documents. It uses two types of memory, i.e., internal memory and external memory. Internal memory is known as RAM, which is volatile in nature. It stores data temporarily, i.e., when the data is ready to be processed, is loaded into RAM, and after processing, it moves data for the storage. On the other hand, external memory is used to store data permanently until you remove it or it got crashed.
Processing: The processing of the input is performed by the CPU, which is the Central Processing Unit of the Computer. It is also known as the brain of a computer that is responsible for processing the data provided by the user. The speed of the computer brain is four times faster than the speed of the human brain.
### Output:
#### When we type something using a keyboard, the place where we see the typed input is the Computer Monitor or Computer Screen. A computer screen allows seeing the input we provided to the Computer. Including this, there are different types of output devices of a computer, such as loudspeakers, projectors, printers, and many more.
These all play a vital role in the working of a computer system.

### Hardware and Software
 The input and output devices that can be physically touched are known as Hardware of the system. Such as keyboard, mouse, screen, etc. The applications that reside in the Computer and can only see them but cannot touch them are known as Software. Such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Paint, and all the installed software on the system.

# What is a computer?

### A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

## Components of a Computer

#### The five classic components of a computer are briefly described below. Each component is discussed in more detail in its own section. The operation of the processor is best understood in terms of these components.

##### 1- Datapath - manipulates the data coming through the processor. It also provides a small amount of temporary data storage.
##### 1- Control - generates control signals that direct the operation of memory and the datapath.
##### 1- Memory - holds instructions and most of the data for currently executing programs.
##### 1- Input - external devices such as keyboards, mice, disks, and networks that provide input to the processor.
##### 1- Output - external devices such as displays, printers, disks, and networks that receive data from the processor.

## Hardware vs. software

#### let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software.

Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.

1- **Hardware** is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.

1- **Software** is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.**
