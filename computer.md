# What is a computer?

### A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

## Components of a Computer

#### The five classic components of a computer are briefly described below. Each component is discussed in more detail in its own section. The operation of the processor is best understood in terms of these components.

##### 1- Datapath - manipulates the data coming through the processor. It also provides a small amount of temporary data storage.
##### 1- Control - generates control signals that direct the operation of memory and the datapath.
##### 1- Memory - holds instructions and most of the data for currently executing programs.
##### 1- Input - external devices such as keyboards, mice, disks, and networks that provide input to the processor.
##### 1- Output - external devices such as displays, printers, disks, and networks that receive data from the processor.

## Hardware vs. software

#### let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software.

Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.
